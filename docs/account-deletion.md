# Anagram Arena Account Deletion

Last updated: February 24, 2026

## How to delete your account
You can delete your Anagram Arena account directly inside the app:

1. Sign in to your account.
2. Open the Profile screen.
3. Select "Delete Account".
4. Confirm deletion in the confirmation modal.

## What is deleted
When your account is deleted, we delete or unlink personal account data, including:

- authentication access for that account
- active login sessions/tokens
- personal linkage between your account and profile identity

## What may be retained
We retain anonymized historical match records required for competitive integrity, abuse prevention, and service reliability.
These records are not retained as an active user account.

## Retention timing
Account access and personal linkage are removed during the deletion flow.
Anonymized records may be retained according to operational retention needs.
