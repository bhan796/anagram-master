# Anagram Arena Privacy Policy

Last updated: February 24, 2026

## Overview
Anagram Arena provides guest and account-based gameplay on web and Android.
This Privacy Policy explains what data is collected, how it is used, and your options.

## Data We Collect
We collect the following categories of data:

- Account data: email address, encrypted password hash, linked auth provider identifiers (if used), and account/session metadata.
- Profile data: display name, rating, ranked game counters, and related player profile fields.
- Gameplay data: match outcomes, scores, and other game telemetry required to provide gameplay and leaderboards.
- Technical data: service logs needed for security, fraud prevention, reliability, and debugging.

## Guest Users
You can play as a guest.
Guest users can access non-ranked modes without creating an account.
Guest users are restricted from ranked and leaderboard features.

## How We Use Data
We use data to:

- operate matchmaking, game sessions, and profile features
- enforce access rules (for example, ranked access for authenticated users)
- secure the service (authentication, abuse prevention, rate limiting, session control)
- maintain and improve app reliability and gameplay quality

## Data Sharing
We do not sell personal data.
We use infrastructure providers to run the service (hosting, database, cache) under standard service agreements.

## Data Retention
- Account/profile data is retained while your account is active.
- Security and operational logs are retained for a limited period as required for abuse prevention and service reliability.
- If you delete your account, personal account linkage is removed while anonymized historical gameplay records may be retained for leaderboard/match integrity.

## Account Deletion
You can request account deletion from within the app.
Deletion removes your account access and personal linkage to profile/session data, subject to the retention behavior above.

## Security
We apply standard safeguards including password hashing, token-based authentication, and server-side authorization checks for protected features.

## Children
Anagram Arena is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13.

## International Users
By using the app, you understand your data may be processed in regions where our infrastructure providers operate.

## Changes to This Policy
We may update this policy from time to time.
The latest version will be posted at this URL with an updated date.
