# Vercel Speed Insights Implementation

Successfully implemented Vercel Speed Insights for the Anagram Arena web application.

## Changes Made

### 1. Package Installation
- Installed `@vercel/speed-insights` package (v1.0.14) via npm
- Updated package.json to include the new dependency
- Updated package-lock.json with the new package and its dependencies

### 2. Component Integration
- Modified `src/App.tsx` to import the SpeedInsights component from `@vercel/speed-insights/react`
- Added the `<SpeedInsights />` component to the `renderWithMute` function
- The component is now included on every screen/route in the application

## Implementation Details

This is a React + Vite application using TypeScript. Following the official Vercel Speed Insights documentation for React applications, I:

1. Installed the package using npm
2. Imported the SpeedInsights component from '@vercel/speed-insights/react'
3. Added the component to the main app wrapper function (`renderWithMute`) which ensures it's present on all routes

The `renderWithMute` function is used throughout the App component to render all screens, making this the ideal location to add Speed Insights so it tracks performance across the entire application.

## Testing

- Build verification: ✅ Successfully built with `npm run build`
- TypeScript compilation: ✅ No type errors
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Next Steps

Once deployed to Vercel:
1. Enable Speed Insights in the Vercel dashboard for this project
2. The `/_vercel/speed-insights/script.js` script will be available after deployment
3. Performance metrics will begin to be collected automatically
4. View the data in the Vercel dashboard under the Speed Insights tab
